#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# install.sh — install the RPA Skills catalog into a directory that
# directory-based agents read as Agent Skills.
#
# Use this for agents that have NO remote plugin marketplace (Cursor, and any
# other tool that discovers skills from a folder). Claude Code and Codex users
# should prefer the native marketplace instead — see README.md:
#   Claude Code:  /plugin marketplace add EvilFreelancer/rpa-skills
#   Codex:        codex plugin marketplace add EvilFreelancer/rpa-skills
#
# What it does: clones (or updates) each split-out skill repository into a
# skills root. The default root is ~/.agents/skills, which is read as a global
# skills directory by Cursor and Codex. Each skill repo keeps SKILL.md at its
# root, so it lands as <root>/<name>/SKILL.md and the agent picks it up by name.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install.sh                      # install/update all skills into ~/.agents/skills
#   ./install.sh -d ~/.cursor/skills  # install into a specific skills root
#   ./install.sh -d .agents/skills    # vendor into the current project (repo-scoped)
#   ./install.sh logika rpa-init      # install only the named skills
#   SKILLS_DIR=~/.cursor/skills ./install.sh   # same as -d, via env var
#
